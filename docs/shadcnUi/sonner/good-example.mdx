Building a toast component
I built a Toast library for React called Sonner in 2023. In this article, I'll show you some of the lessons I've learned and mistakes I made while building it.

Animations
Initially, I used CSS keyframes for enter and exit animations, but they aren't interruptible. A CSS transition can be interrupted and smoothly transition to a new value, even before the first transition has finished. You can see the difference below.

Add toast

Transitions
To transition the toast when it enters the screen, essentially to mimic the enter animation, we used useEffect to set the mounted state to true after the first render. This way, the toast is rendered with transform: translateY(100%) and then transitions to transform: translateY(0). The style is based on a data attribute.

React.useEffect(() => {
  setMounted(true);
}, []);
 
//...
 
<li data-mounted={mounted}>
Stacking toasts
To create the stacking effect, we multiply the gap between toasts by the index of the toast to get the y position. It's worth noting that every toast has position: absolute to make stacking easier. We also scale them down by 0.05 * index to create the illusion of depth. Here's the simplified CSS for it:

[data-sonner-toast][data-expanded="false"][data-front="false"] {
  --scale: var(--toasts-before) * 0.05 + 1;
  --y: translateY(calc(var(--lift-amount) * var(--toasts-before))) scale(
      calc(-1 * var(--scale))
    );
}
This works great until you have toasts with different heights, they won't stick out evenly. We fix it by simply making all the toasts the height of the toast in front when in stacked mode. Here's how the toasts would look with different heights:

Add toast
Swiping
The toasts can be swiped down to dismiss. That's just a simple event listener on the toast which updates a variable responsible for the translateY value.

// This is a simplified version of the code
const onMove = (event) => {
  const yPosition = event.clientY - pointerStartRef.current.y;
 
  toastRef.current?.style.setProperty("--swipe-amount", `${yPosition}px`);
};
The swipe is momentum-based, meaning you don't have to swipe until a specific threshold is met to remove the toast. If the swipe movement is fast enough, the toast will still be dismissed because the velocity is high enough.

const timeTaken = new Date().getTime() - dragStartTime.current.getTime();
const velocity = Math.abs(swipeAmount) / timeTaken;
 
// Remove if the threshold is met or velocity is high enough
if (Math.abs(swipeAmount) >= SWIPE_THRESHOLD || velocity > 0.11) {
  deleteToast();
}
Expanding toasts
We calculate the expanded position of each toast by adding the heights of all preceding toasts and the gap between them. This value will become the new translateY when the user hovers over the toast area.

const toastsHeightBefore = React.useMemo(() => {
  return heights.reduce((prev, curr, reducerIndex) => {
    // Calculate offset up until current toast
    if (reducerIndex >= heightIndex) {
      return prev;
    }
 
    return prev + curr.height;
  }, 0);
}, [heights, heightIndex]);
 
// ...
 
const offset = React.useMemo(
  () => heightIndex * GAP + toastsHeightBefore,
  [heightIndex, toastsHeightBefore]
);
State management
To avoid using context, we manage the state via the Observer Pattern. We subscribe to the observable object in the <Toaster /> component. Whenever the toast() function is called, the <Toaster /> component (as the subscriber) is notified and updates its state. We can then render all the toasts using Array.map().

function Toaster() {
  React.useEffect(() => {
    return ToastState.subscribe((toast) => {
      setToasts((toasts) => [...toasts, toast]);
    });
  }, []);
 
  // ...
 
  return (
    <ol>
      {toasts.map((toast, index) => (
        <Toast key={toast.id} toast={toast} />
      ))}
    </ol>
  );
}
To create a new toast, we simply import toast and call it. There's no need for hooks or context, just a straightforward function call.

import { toast } from "sonner";
 
// ...
 
toast("My toast");
Hover state
The hover state depends on whether we are hovering over one of the toasts. However, there are also gaps between the toasts. To address this, we add an :after pseudo-element to fill in these gaps, ensuring a consistent hover state. You will see these filled gaps depicted below.

Add toast
Pointer capture
Once we start dragging, we set the toast to capture all future pointer events. This ensures that even if the mouse or our thumb moves outside the toast while dragging, the toast remains the target of the pointer events. As a result, dragging remains possible, even if we are outside of the toast, leading to a better user experience.

function onPointerDown(event) {
  event.target.setPointerCapture(event.pointerId);
}
Why is Sonner successful?
There are two reasons why Sonner is downloaded over 4,000,000 times per week from npm. One is that the developer experience is good. No hooks, no context, you insert <Toaster /> once and you call toast() to create a toast, that's it.

Two is that it looks good. It has nice defaults and good animations. This is the real differentiator here. People love beautiful things.
