# User Management UI Concepts

This document outlines the conceptual design for the User Management interface, which will be accessible to users with the "admin" role.

---

## 1. User List Page

*   **Route:** `/admin/users` (or a similar route protected for admins)
*   **Purpose:** To display a comprehensive list of all users in the system, allowing administrators to view and manage them.
*   **Components:**
    *   **User Table:**
        *   Columns: ID (optional, or for debug), Name, Email, Role, Email Verified (boolean/icon), Created At, Updated At.
        *   Each row should represent a single user.
    *   **Pagination Controls:**
        *   If the number of users is large, pagination will be necessary (e.g., "Previous", "Next", page numbers).
    *   **Search/Filter Bar:**
        *   Search by Name or Email.
        *   Filter by Role (dropdown: All, Admin, Manager, User).
        *   Filter by Email Verified status (dropdown: All, Yes, No).
    *   **"Create User" Button:** A prominent button that navigates to the Create User page.
*   **Actions per User (in table row or on selection):**
    *   **"Edit" Button/Link:** Navigates to the Edit User page for the selected user.
    *   **"Delete" Button:** Initiates the Delete User confirmation process for the selected user.
*   **Access Control:** This page and its functionalities should only be accessible to users with the "admin" role (enforced by middleware and potentially client-side checks).

## 2. Create User Page

*   **Route:** `/admin/users/new` (or a similar route)
*   **Purpose:** To provide a form for administrators to add new users to the system.
*   **Components:**
    *   **Form Fields:**
        *   Name: Text input, required.
        *   Email: Email input, required, must be unique.
        *   Password: Password input, required, with confirmation field recommended.
        *   Role: Select dropdown (Admin, Manager, User), required.
    *   **"Save" / "Create User" Button:** Submits the form to create the user.
    *   **"Cancel" Button:** Discards changes and navigates back to the User List page.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Client-side validation for required fields, email format, and password strength/match.
    *   On submit, calls the `POST /api/users` endpoint.
*   **Access Control:** Admin only.

## 3. Edit User Page

*   **Route:** `/admin/users/edit/{id}` (where `{id}` is the user's ID)
*   **Purpose:** To allow administrators to modify the details of an existing user.
*   **Components:**
    *   **Form Fields (pre-filled with existing user data):**
        *   Name: Text input, required.
        *   Email: Email input, required, must be unique if changed.
        *   Password: Optional section for changing the password. Could be "New Password" and "Confirm New Password" fields, separate from the main form or revealed on click.
        *   Role: Select dropdown (Admin, Manager, User), required.
        *   Email Verified: Display only (e.g., a checkbox that is read-only, or text "Yes/No"). Verification might be a separate process.
    *   **"Update" / "Save Changes" Button:** Submits the form to update the user.
    *   **"Cancel" Button:** Discards changes and navigates back to the User List page.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Client-side validation for fields being edited.
    *   On submit, calls the `PUT /api/users/{id}` endpoint.
    *   Careful consideration for password changes: only update if a new password is provided.
*   **Access Control:** Admin only.

## 4. Delete User Confirmation

*   **Purpose:** To prevent accidental deletion of users by requiring explicit confirmation.
*   **Components:**
    *   **Modal/Dialog Box:**
        *   Displays a confirmation message (e.g., "Are you sure you want to delete user 'John Doe'? This action cannot be undone.").
        *   Shows user details (Name, Email) for verification.
    *   **"Confirm Delete" Button:** Proceeds with the deletion by calling `DELETE /api/users/{id}`.
    *   **"Cancel" Button:** Closes the modal/dialog without deleting the user.
*   **Trigger:** Initiated by clicking the "Delete" button on the User List page for a specific user.
*   **Considerations:**
    *   Preventing an admin from deleting their own account (API should enforce this, UI can also check).

## 5. General UI/UX Considerations

*   **Layout:** Consistent admin layout with clear navigation.
*   **Loading States:** Visual feedback (e.g., spinners, disabled buttons) during data fetching or form submissions.
*   **Error Message Display:**
    *   Inline validation errors for form fields (e.g., "Email is required", "Password must be at least 8 characters").
    *   General error messages for API failures (e.g., "Failed to create user. Email already exists.", "An unexpected error occurred."). These are often displayed as toast notifications or a dedicated error message area.
*   **Success Notifications:**
    *   Toast notifications or messages for successful actions (e.g., "User created successfully", "User updated.", "User deleted.").
*   **Restricted Access:**
    *   While middleware handles route protection, client-side checks (e.g., using `useSession` and role information) can be used to conditionally render UI elements or redirect if somehow an unauthorized user lands on an admin page component.
*   **Responsiveness:** The UI should be usable on different screen sizes.

This conceptual outline provides a basis for building the User Management interface. Specific UI components and styling will depend on the chosen component library (e.g., Tailwind CSS components, Shadcn/ui) and overall application design.
