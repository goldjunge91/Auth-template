# Client-Side Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Conceptualization

Client-side components can leverage session data to dynamically render UI elements and control functionality based on the authenticated user's role. This enhances user experience by only showing relevant options and protects actions that the user is not authorized to perform.

## Accessing Session Data

The primary way to access session data in client components is by using the `useSession()` hook provided by `next-auth/react`. This requires wrapping the application (or relevant parts of it) in a `<SessionProvider>` component, typically in a layout file or the main application entry point.

```tsx
// Example: src/app/layout.tsx or a specific client component
"use client"; // Required for components using hooks

import { useSession, SessionProvider } from "next-auth/react";

function MyComponent() {
  const { data: session, status } = useSession();

  if (status === "loading") {
    return <p>Loading...</p>;
  }

  if (status === "unauthenticated" || !session) {
    // Handle unauthenticated state, e.g., show a login prompt
    return <p>Please log in to access this content.</p>;
  }

  // Now you can use session.user.role
  const userRole = session.user?.role;

  // ... rest of your component logic
}
```

## Conditional Rendering of UI Elements

Based on `session.user.role`, different UI elements can be rendered or their properties modified:

1.  **Buttons and Interactive Elements:**
    *   Admin-specific buttons can be enabled/disabled or shown/hidden.
    *   Example:
        ```tsx
        {session.user?.role === 'admin' && <button>Manage Users</button>}
        // or
        <button disabled={session.user?.role !== 'admin'}>Delete Item</button>
        ```

2.  **Navigation Links:**
    *   Navigation menus can filter links based on the user's role, preventing them from seeing links to sections they cannot access.
    *   Example:
        ```tsx
        <nav>
          <Link href="/dashboard">Dashboard</Link>
          {session.user?.role === 'admin' && <Link href="/admin/settings">Admin Settings</Link>}
          {['admin', 'manager'].includes(session.user?.role || '') && <Link href="/manager/reports">Manager Reports</Link>}
        </nav>
        ```

3.  **Data Display and Forms:**
    *   Certain data fields or form sections might only be visible or editable by users with specific roles.
    *   Example:
        ```tsx
        <div>
          <p>User Name: {userData.name}</p>
          {session.user?.role === 'admin' && <p>User Email (Admin View): {userData.email}</p>}
        </div>
        ```

## Conditional Data Fetching

*   Data fetching hooks (like `useEffect` with `fetch`, or libraries like SWR/React Query) can be conditionally called.
*   Alternatively, the user's role can be passed as a parameter to backend API calls. The backend then uses this information to filter or shape the data returned, ensuring that users only receive data they are authorized to see. This is crucial as client-side checks are for UI/UX improvement and not a substitute for backend security.
    *   Example:
        ```tsx
        useEffect(() => {
          if (session.user?.role === 'manager') {
            fetch(`/api/manager/data?userId=${session.user.id}`)
              .then(res => res.json())
              .then(setData);
          }
        }, [session]);
        ```

## Important Considerations

*   **Client-side RBAC is primarily for UI/UX enhancement.** It should not be the sole mechanism for protecting resources.
*   **Backend authorization is critical.** Always enforce RBAC on the server-side (e.g., in API routes and middleware) to prevent unauthorized access or data manipulation, as client-side code can be bypassed.
*   The `useSession` hook provides `status` ('loading', 'authenticated', 'unauthenticated') which should be handled to provide a good user experience during session validation.

By combining session data with conditional rendering logic, client-side components can adapt to the user's role, providing a more tailored and secure experience.
